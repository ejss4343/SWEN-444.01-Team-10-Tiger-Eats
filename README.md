## Introduction
- Our new system Tiger Eats will be replacing the previous RIT On-demand ordering system by creating a more streamlined ordering process. The system will be available to RIT students, dining faculty, and visitors. Our design vision is to make the ordering experience feel seamless and while also providing additional information and choice for the students. Our focus on a streamlined ordering process will allow users to feel less overwhelmed by inconsistent organizational choices, allowing them to also save time while ordering and leaving them with a sense of confidence and safety by alerting them of allergens and making nutrition info easier to find.
